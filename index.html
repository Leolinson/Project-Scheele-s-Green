        <p>So, a pattern emerged in our investigation: all of the deceased have<br> green wallpaper.Also, our chemist found that rooms with such<br> wallpaper smelled like mice. <br>

            After laboratory tests, he came to a shocking conclusion.</p>

            <p>The chemist Carl Scheele discovered emerald paint in 1775 while<br> experimenting with arsenic. The paint quickly became popular and<br> was named “Scheele's Green”.<br>
                The scientist was aware that the paint was poisonous, but he<br> produces it anyway. At the age of 43, he dies of poisoning.
